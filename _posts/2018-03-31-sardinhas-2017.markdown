## \>  A season to celebrate

I participated in the *<i>[Concurso Sardinhas 2017](http://lisboanarua.com/festasdelisboa/2017/05/24/sardinhas-vencedoras-2017/){:target="_blank"}</i>* organised by *<i>Empresa de Gestão de Equipamentos e Animação Cultural</i>* in celebration of *<i>Festa de Lisboa</i>*. This yearly contest consists of making art in the form of sardine.

I started by cutting spaces within the given sardine silhoutte template. I then had the idea of morphing these spaces and forms into a *ballerina*, dancing to celebrate the festival of Lisbon. I played with hiding multiple sardines on the ballerina. I then smoothened the contours and tried adding mild and, later, vivid colours to the spaces with reference to *colouring books* for children and *stained glass windows* of churches.

The sardines became a ballerina, the ballerina became Spring.

Imagining that children could play with this colouring template, for making this colour model more *accessible* to children with sight conditions, when the illustration/graphics are passed to greyscale, the ballerina can be still obviously seen.
