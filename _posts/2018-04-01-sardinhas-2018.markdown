## \>  A diverse mosaic

In 2018, I participated again in the annual *<i>[Concurso Sardinhas](http://lisboanarua.com/blog/2018/02/15/esta-aberto-concurso-sardinhas-festas-lisboa-2018/){:target="_blank"}</i>* organised by *<i>Empresa de Gestão de Equipamentos e Animação Cultural</i>* in celebration of *<i>Festa de Lisboa</i>*. This yearly contest consists of making art in the form of sardine.

This year, I had the idea from the aminal nature of sardine - *forage fish*. In the ocean, sardines swim together in schools. They usuallly form a big group of fish to move around. Of course deep down they are all different individuals. But together they are stronger.

I started with the idea of *immitating* a *child drawing* fish in different colours. I then continued by exploring the combination of colours and the forms of representing sardines. I further tried bringing different sizes, thicknesses, positions, and postures of each together. I concluded on to the style of *Asian paintbrush* to represent their form.

Eventually, all the individually unique sardines formed a beautiful, lively mosaic of themselves. Together they are one!
