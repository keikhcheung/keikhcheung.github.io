*<i>[MesInfos](http://mesinfos.fing.org/english/){:target="_blank"}</i>* is a project initiated by the *<i>[Fondation Internet Nouvelle Génération (la Fing)](http://fing.org/?About-Fing){:target="_blank"}</i>* which aims to *regain control on our personal data* created upon usage of difference services, scattered across various providers. Through data, it allows individuals to look back at their own behaviour in the past, understand the causes and consequences, and to take necessary adjustment to their future actions in their own needs. Via the platform *[Cozy Cloud](https://cozy.io/en/)*, users can centralise their data in a personal, secure cloud, powered by *<i>la Fing</i>*, *Cozy Cloud* and the community of open source developers.

In this project, we collaborate with *<i>la Fing</i>* and *Cozy Cloud*. Our focus is on the user's aspect and how we can improve user experience in order to **better attract potential target users**.

We held a meeting with our client to *better understand* their ambition in this project, their needs and how we could assist them. We then brought out intensive *analyses* of the existing alpha platform and of the feedback provided on the test user forum.

We conducted several *user interviews* so as to comprehend more directly problems they encounter upon usage and to discern their expectations.

We then grouped our discoveries into three major *problems*. We cross-studied them with the platform's *user profile types*. We *brainstormed* on possible interventions and solutions. Then we further shaped all our ideas, crystalised them into *3 scenarios* which correspond to *3 personae*, evaluated the advantages and limits of each, and objectively *presented* them to our client.

Our client appreciated our production. Under the time constraint in the academic framework, they selected the 3<sup>rd</sup> scenario, which aims to **fortify the unique selling points (USPs)** of the platform within its own self, but can also be versatilely used as promotions for new feature in future development.

Subsequently, for solving the problem of the selected scenario, we invented *3 usage cases*, as per *3 different unique selling points (USPs)* which the platform could bring to its users. We concretised their implementation in the form of *visual storytelling*. Our strategy adopted here is to omit as much as possible the complicated technical aspect, but to **emphasise the direct, observable benefits** which the platform can bring to them.

We did a *benchmark* to see how existing digital service platforms promote themselves before building *[visual mock-ups](https://invis.io/9UBH1AVTG#/231254425_1-accueil){:target="_blank"}* integrated into the beta version of the platform for our client.

Finally, we *pitched* our project in front of the jury, which was composed of professors and other projects' clients. We wrote as well an *advisory report* detailing our approches, analyses, concepts, recommendations, and a suggested development *road map*.
