This project is framed as innovating the Internet of things (IoT) for *winter sports*. We started the project by *brainstorming* inspiration from activities, environments, objects, users, and interactions in between and around the ski resort. Soon we recognise the *inherent problem*: **heavy clothes and thick gloves block the use of digital products**.

We narrowed down the population of winter sports to the target of families which ski for leisure. We focused on their *typical usage journey* and identified what digital service could bring to them:

Since children are often separated from parents in the day for *ski classes*, parents might want to witness the learning progress of the beloved, and maybe sharing the best moments with distant relatives.

We thus prioritised to invent **a mechanism which simplify taking and sharing ski videos, as well as documenting learning progress in ski classes**.

Here is our service product ecosystem corresponding to the problem - *SnowRec*. At the end of the day, the ski tutor usually asks the students to ski downhill one by one. It all starts from the tutor's *ski goggles*, equipped with a *camera* which can be turned on by a large mechanical button on the side, or by vocal keyword commands. Video of the skiing student will be recorded as the tutor follows him/her with the eyes.

The camera is connected to the tutor's smartphone by Bluetooth, through which recorded videos are sent directly to the designated SnowRec application. Class participants are automatically identified by *facial recognition*, or by the individual QR code printed on their vest.

Through the application, tutor can **evaluate students' performance, distribute award badges, and publish videos** so that parents and children can watch them on their personal account, accessible by the user login given while their application to the ski school. *Tutor's remarks* and a *learning curve* could be found there; *video downloading* and *sharing* on social media are possible, too.

We built some simple *wireframes* to test our concept. Following the feedbacks in return, we decided to remove the QR code and attach to facial recognition. Moreover, we simplified mobile menus and interface. Tutorial videos were also added for children to learn furthermore skiing techniques.

As we wanted to make our ecosystem fun and educative to users and pay tribute to the mountain environment at the same time, a friendly, warming *graphic identity* with natural fades was introduced. Award badges were redesigned to become more cheerful, too.

We evolved our wireframes of the ecosystem *SnowRec*. The final *interactive prototype* can be found online:

- [Mobile version](http://vghtbq.axshare.com/#g=1&p=connexion){:target="_blank"} - for ski tutor
- [Web version](https://xd.adobe.com/view/4ae14c76-5cb5-495d-9653-da3831bbe80a/){:target="_blank"} - for parents and children

Eventually, we wrote a detailed *design process report* and set up an *exhibition booth* to display our final products at the art and design school *<i>[La Martinière Diderot](http://www.lamartinierediderot.fr/){:target="_blank"}</i>*. As visitors came to us, we *pitched* our project and invited them to try our prototype out.
