# Problem
**Museum curators** spend a lot of time and effort in organising an exhibition. Once it is launched, they are often already on the go again for the next one and have little time to **optimise current show**. How can we help them *get the most out of every exhibition?*

# Backdrop
[MuseoPic](http://www.museopic.com){:target="_blank"} is a smartphoen application which enhances ordinary museum visits. Through *augmented reality*, visitors can interact with exhibits, learn more about their story behind, and create their own collections. It has been deployed in contemporary art, design, and natural sciences museums in üá´üá∑Lyon areas[^1].

MuseoPic Analytics captures visitors' interaction with exhibits and *transform that data into useful insights* for museum personnel, so that they can easily understand their current programme's performance & settings, and make adaptation right away. This help them better align exhibitions with their visitors, raise discoverability and engagement, maximise üéübox office sales as well as ‚≠êÔ∏èpublic reviews, and better develop content management and strategy.

# Hands-on
In order to better understand the organisation and typical workflow of museums, we conducted several *interviews with our target users*, namely the museum directors, quality control attach√©s and content managers.

We then analysed their actions and needs regarding the life cycle of exhibitions, extracted their *jobs-to-be-done (JTBDs)*. We framed some major challenges & problems and mapped some üéàopportunities.

Following the evolution of ideas, we clustered them in *use case scenarios*. We actively involved our users and stakeholders for comments and feedback while iterating our design cycles to create *mock-ups for the analytics platform*.

In the end of our partnership, we packaged our findings and handed off our prototypes with UX strategy advice to our client.
