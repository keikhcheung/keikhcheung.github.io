# Problem
Chamrousse Tourism Office website dates back to 2010. Its convoluted information architecture has made the access to alerts, promotional offers, facility information and activity plans lost in an enigmatic navigation; content scattered all around the site.💆🏽‍♀️💆🏻‍♂️

# Study
We started with a *content audit* and classified the types of information. We discerned scenarios & entry points to the website and analysed visitors' online journey. A *benchmark* was carried out to compare competitors' market position and to *sharpen Chamrousse's ✨strategic selling points*.

# Hands-on
After shuffling the architecture and standardising navigation paths, we produced quick and dirty paper mock-ups for testing our *🔀user flow*. We iterated our design according to testers' feedback. We put ski resort visitors' concern to our highest priority, but also retained a seasonal touch for summer activities.

At the same time, we refreshed Chamrousse Tourism Office's *visual identity* and their online interfaces, to give it a fresh, energetic yet calming look.😄

We created *wireframes & visual mock-ups* for the new website, together with a analytical report on our design process and recommendations for their content management.
