# Problem
Collaborative work can be tough when you do not share the same vision… especially when you are *5,000+ altogether across the world!?* 🌎🌍🌏

# Status quo
TÜV Rheinland is a 145-year-old-and-growing certification service provider for all kinds of technical standards, ranging from 🧸baby toys to 🚜heavy machinery. It holds offices worldwide and work with test centres and laboratories across continents.

To guarantee quality and security, products are examined and tested comprehensively at TÜV, often at the best situations in different 👨🏻‍🔬regional labs. Hence, *delegation, coordination & management* between divisions are crucial to their success and competitiveness.

But protocols and concensus do not always come naturally. Departments have developed their unique ways of work over time. A *shared standard work tool* along the international production becomes necessary to bring people and work together.  
🙋🏾‍♀️🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏾‍♂️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏼‍♂️

# Concept
That's how ComPASS came to live! ComPASS is a *workflow platform* tailor-made for TÜV's global business. It accompanies their various teams through thier production process and *🧭provide orientation* to players on complex proejcts. From order placement & analysis, labour division & cooperation, to lab tests, reports & follow-ups——every pace is incorporated and taken care of on ComPASS.

# Hands-on
We met with their international business and technical departments to conduct *🔍user research*. By understanding and analysing their process and roles, we discovered insights in how to *digitise, innovate and reshape their global workflow*. We tried to, as well, tactically find the common ground for geographical *work culture & habits*. This led us to a flexible, scalable system which not only consolidates their business as a whole, but also tones in well with different team players across the board. ⛹🏻‍♀️⛹🏽‍♂️

We work in an *intercontinental dual-track agile team* across seven locations: 🇯🇵Yokohama, 🇭🇰Hong Kong, 🇨🇳Shanghai, 🇹🇼Taipei, 🇬🇧London, 🇩🇪Nuremberg, and 🇩🇪Cologne. We take care of the exploration and insight discovery, as well as guaranteeing end product delivery. Altogether we are building the ComPASS platform and simultaneously *developing a design system* for TÜV Rheinland for their other forthcoming digital products.

# Result
*Higher transparency* along the global pipeline, *better management & coordination* of working teams, *closer collaboration* between business & technical departments——all towards a **stronger service provision, catalysing customer satisfaction**. 😄🧭
