# Concept
On Tintoretto2Go, we **hijacked advertisements** around the city of Cologne and Berlin by replacing them with first-class paintings. 💎Hidden gems in these artworks were spotlit with **animated 3D modelling in AR**, letting the public relive the spectacles of the grand classic. What's more? We hid them all around the city and updated every week——it's the <mark>treasure hunt in neighbourhoods</mark> and in the streets!🕵🏻‍♀️🕵🏽‍♂️ No matter if you unlock all of them or not, it guides you to explore Wallraf-Richartz Museum's special exhibition 'Tintoretto——A Star was Born' in the end, and offers you a discount to the museum if you find them all!✨

# Hands-on
Starting with literature review in different languages and expert interviews, we found out the highlights in the 🖼licensed paintings and created **compelling storytelling** out from the artworks. We consolidated the narratives and produced 🌌storyboards, consulted the museum curator and gathered feedback, before we went into 3D modelling/animation and development with the team.

Later, we tested our prototype and further improved our 👾game experience. Every week we updated the visual markers to enhance the city hunt amusement. 🏃🏻‍♂️🏃🏼‍♀️
