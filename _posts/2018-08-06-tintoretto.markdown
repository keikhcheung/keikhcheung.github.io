## \>  Treasure hunt in the city
In the celebration of the 500<sup>th</sup> birthday of the Italian artist *Jacopo Tintoretto*, *<i>[Wallraf-Richartz Museum](https://www.wallraf.museum){:target="_blank"}</i>* in Cologne, Germany held a [dedicated exhibition](https://www.wallraf.museum/2017-10-06-tintoretto/){:target="_blank"} featuring his *[Renaissance paintings](https://www.wallraf.museum/2017-10-06-tintoretto/exponate/){:target="_blank"}*.

*<i>[denkwerk GmbH](https://www.denkwerk.com){:target="_blank"}</i>* had the idea of using *visual recognition* and *augmented reality (AR)* to **hijack advertisement posters in the city and replacing them with artwork**, allowing people to discover the hidden gems within Tintoretto's paintings, especially bringing [a younger generation](http://www.pipipi.de/tintoretto_en.html){:target="_blank"} to the Renaissance art.

In this project, my role was to create an engaging experience for this *[‘city hunt’ game](https://www.tintoretto2go.de){:target="_blank"}* in Cologne and Berlin.

This project has won the [**Gold Medal**](https://www.denkwerk.com/news/376-gold-rush){:target="_blank"} in *'Digital Out Of Home'* category of the [**Golden Awards of Montreux 2018**](http://www.goldenawardmontreux.com/winners2018/winners2018-digital.html){:target="_blank"}, the [**SILBER**](https://www.denkwerk.com/news/387-6-projects-7-awards){:target="_blank"} in *'Digitale Sonderformate'* category of the [**Annual Multimedia Awards 2019**](https://www.annual-multimedia.de/gewinner_2019/){:target="_blank"}, and the [**Bronze Lovie Awards 2018**](https://winners.lovieawards.eu/#!y=2018&m=274){:target="_blank"} for the *best user experience* in *'Mobile & Applications'*.

At the beginning, I studied the licensed paintings, dug into the *literature review* in different languages, and found out interesting highlights in the paintings.

I then collaborated with visual designers to create *storyboards* for the expecience.

We met with the museum curator to present our ideas and collected feedback from the artistic point of view.

Later, I also worked with copywriters, 3D artists and developers to implement our concepts into the game *prototype*.
I directed *user tests* to gather remarks for improving the game experience and conducted on-site tests for *quality control*.
