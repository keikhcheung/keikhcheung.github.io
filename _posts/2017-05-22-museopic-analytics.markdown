*<i>[MuseoPic](http://www.museopic.com){:target="_blank"}</i>* is a smartphone application which aims at **enhancing classic museum visit experience**. Through *visual recognition*, *augmented reality* and *geolocation*, visitors can instantly obtain supplementary information about exhibits, interact with showpieces, explore museums in a ludic way and create personalised collections which they can review anytime later without venue constraints.

In this project, my team and I work on the design of *data analytics*, a platform which is dedicated to *museum personnel*. This analytic tool visualises raw data generated by *<i>MuseoPic</i>* application end users and help the personnel in **exhibition evaluation, content management and strategy development** in an atypical way.

In order to understand better functional procedures, organisation and typical usage of museums, we conducted several *interviews* with our *target users*, namely the museum director, quality control attaché and content manager.

We then *analysed* their *jobs to be done (JTBD)*, their *needs*, and their exhibition life cycles. We outlined noticeable *problems*. *Brainstorming* sessions were then carried out to invent possible solutions.

We presented our ideas in *scenarios* to our client, exchanged comments and feedbacks. We gradually brought our concepts to life by building quick and dirty *paper mock-ups*, *iterative evaluation* and *digital wireframes*.

We finalised our project by fine-tuning our *digital prototypes*. We handed the deliverables to our client together with our *UX strategy advice*.
