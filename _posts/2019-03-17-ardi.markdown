## \>  AI for Research
As a participation in the Microsoft AI Award 2019 Agency Edition, *<i>[denkwerk GmbH](https://www.denkwerk.com){:target="_blank"}</i>* had the idea of incorporating *artificial intelligence (AI)* into design agency's workflow.

*Ardi* is an **AI-powered research tool** which aims to *facilitate the research practices* that design agencies perform routinely. It targets the problem of cumbersome (re)searching work and uses *Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services* to detect, collect, cluster and summarise results. With the use of *text analytics* and *content-sensitive algorithms*, Ardi enhances the research workflow, raises efficiency in insight discovery, reduces the cost of research processes, unlocks and verbalises knowledge, and advances human communication and creation.

This project has won the [**2<sup>nd</sup> place**](https://www.denkwerk.com/news/391-gesucht-gefunden-gewonnen-ardi-gewinnt-microsoft-ai-award){:target="_blank"} in *'AI for Businesses'* category of the **Microsoft AI Award 2019 â€“ Agency Edition**.
