## \>  A chemical experiment

I always have the habit of bringing an analogue camera with me wherever I go. I use it to record places where I find the atmosphere impressive. Sometimes, when it arrives, I transform my feelings into loose stanzas of words.

This 56-page booklet is an attempt to mix these two ordinary practices and find a new formula of creation in between.
