This is a project to design and build a chair within a 4-month period.

I chose to explore the possibilities of a single, continuous line in relation with a chair; whether we could **form a stable, sitting surface with only one line**, while maintaining the *aesthetic* of its *simplicity*, standing its *functional purposes*, and satisfying the *comfort* of sitter(s).

After an extensive *research* into physics, ergonomics and aethetics, *simulation prototyping* and *testing* were conducted. I concluded on to one design for building the final chair.

The chair consists of two pieces of components: a *steel frame* in the form of a continuous line, and a *wooden plank* which could be laid on top to easily form a sitting surface. The sitting surface is elongated and designed to, for one person, support both *sitting* and *leaning*, with an ergonormically curved armrest/back; the strength of the material would also allow two persons to sit on top of it at the same time.

I worked with iron and steel specialists and carpenters in their ateliers and workshops and realised the *1-to-1 chair prototype*.

The chair was tested and approved by peer students of the furniture design class as well as professors of the faculty.
