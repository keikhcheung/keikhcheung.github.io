This is a *simulation* of *Scrum framework* of *Agile development principles* for *project management*. The objective is to construct an ideal city for a product owner in 30 minutes.

**Contraints** are *3 iteration phases* at maximum, each consists of a *7-minute sprint* in which our team try to build the city up phase by phase with Lego and drawings.

The *product owner* listed **13 criteria** for her ideal city: a sushi restaurant, a hospital, a digital co-working place, an art gallery, a giant park, a concert hall, an Olympic swimming pool, an organic food store, a Belgian bar, an art house cinema, a game bar, a tram system and a beach.

Our *scrum master* led the scrum team in estimating time and resources needed to realise each criterion. The product owner prioritised her criteria upon personal preference.

In each *phase*, our team pulled tasks from *backlog* to *sprint* and decided which tasks to be accomplished by whom.

During each 7-minute *sprint*, each team member constructs his/her responsible part of the city.

At the end of each phase, the product owner *evaluated* our production. Accepted criteria were moved from *sprint* and marked as *done*, whereas unsatisfactory ones were rejected back to *backlog*. Comments were also given if any specific *modification* was wanted.

As *iterations* followed, our team approached and materialised her ideal city step by step.

By the end of the third iteration, all criteria were satisfied with an additional leading element added: a private mansion for the project owner.

She then named her ideal city **‘Compact City‘** and *presented* it to the public.
