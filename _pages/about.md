My name is 👨🏻‍💻Kei. I am an Experience Designer currently based in Cologne, Germany. I work predominantly for designing <mark>human-centred digital services & products</mark>, with attention to the <mark>social connections</mark> & <mark>systems behind</mark>.

In my spare time, I read about 📚📰socio-politics, think about 🕹🔀interactions, write on ✏️💬current issues, do literary & audiovisual explorations, and take care of 🌵plants. You can check out some of my thoughts [on my public notes](https://notes.keikhcheung.com){:target="_blank"}.

I speak English, French, Cantonese, Mandarin Chinese, and GIF; also a bit of German, Portuguese, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My background crosses design, socio-politics and digital humanities. I am an alumnus of *École Normale Supérieure de Lyon*, Hong Kong Baptist University and *Université Sorbonne Nouvelle Paris 3*.

I wrote my master’s thesis on UX of voice assistants, where I explored how to design for anticipatory assistance based on usage environments’ context. You can [read it online](https://dumas.ccsd.cnrs.fr/dumas-01981716){:target="_blank"}.

I lectured at MacEwan University on UX in voice user interface as a guest.
