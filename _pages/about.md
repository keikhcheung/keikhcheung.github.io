My background crosses design, socio-politics and digital humanities. I am an alumnus of *École Normale Supérieure de Lyon*, Hong Kong Baptist University and *Université Sorbonne Nouvelle Paris 3*.

I wrote my master’s thesis on UX of voice assistants, where I explored how to design for anticipatory assistance based on usage environments’ context. You can [read it online](https://dumas.ccsd.cnrs.fr/dumas-01981716){:target="_blank"}. I also gave a guest lecture at MacEwan University’s Design Studies about UX in voice user interface (DESN 341).
