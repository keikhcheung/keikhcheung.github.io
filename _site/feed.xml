&lt;p&gt;I always have the habit of bringing an analogue camera with me wherever I go. I use it to record places where I find the atmosphere impressive. Sometimes, when it arrives, I transform my feelings into loose stanzas of words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 56-page booklet is an attempt to mix these two ordinary practices and find a &lt;em&gt;new formula of creation&lt;/em&gt; in between.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>L'≈íuvre de ma vie &amp;colon; short film in 36 hours</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;backdrop&quot;&gt;Backdrop&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything started with üé∂&lt;i&gt;Mozart‚Äôs Requiem in D minor, K. 626&lt;/i&gt;, a song around which our short had to encircle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;synopsis&quot;&gt;Synopsis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, &lt;i&gt;Monsieur&lt;/i&gt; receives a medical letter which declares his üöëcritical health situation and his imminent death. Disheartened by this news, he laments in tears, until the servants bring him to his bucket list, of which the last item‚Äî‚Äîcreate his life-time masterpiece‚Äî‚Äîremains unchecked‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ardi&amp;colon; AI for research</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;extras&quot;&gt;

  &lt;h5 id=&quot;awards&quot;&gt;Awards&lt;/h5&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Second place, ‚ÄòAI for Businesses‚Äô, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.denkwerk.com/en/blog/ardi-receives-microsoft-ai-award&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Microsoft AI Award 2019 ‚Äì Agency Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have a question, search engines have your answers‚Äî‚Äî12,450,000,000 of them in 0.49 seconds‚ÄºÔ∏è Is the one your want there? &lt;em&gt;Can you dig it out in time?&lt;/em&gt; üîç&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;status-quo&quot;&gt;Status quo&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know the pain when our doubt and curiousity cannot be resolved.ü§î We look here and there desperately, but are left in sole &lt;em&gt;uncertainty&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes, we might have a slight hint after swimming in portfolio of text‚Äî‚Äîif we‚Äôre lucky‚Äî‚Äîbut that could well only lead us to further open waters‚Ä¶ üèäüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;video autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;/videos/portfolio/ardi-logo.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;extras&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;concept&quot;&gt;Concept&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with data specialists, we imagine Ardi as an artificial intelligence‚Äìpowered research tool which &lt;em&gt;facilitates research practices&lt;/em&gt;. It uses Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services to detect, collect and cluster search results into üìöcategories and offer your &lt;em&gt;succinct abstracts&lt;/em&gt;. These summaries can be dragged and dropped to your üìúresearch document, which it further analyses. Ardi then detects directions of related subjects and return you with &lt;em&gt;content-sensitive suggestions&lt;/em&gt; through its algorithms. In short: &lt;strong&gt;a research tool that concurrently offers analysis!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/ardi-ui.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Interface of Ardi, simultaneous research and analysis driven by artificial cognitive intelligence&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worked out the architecture and trialed some simulation settings. Instead of linear look-ups, Ardi can assist in &lt;em&gt;multi-directional exploration&lt;/em&gt;, filters out repetitive noise, and skims down results into their essence.üí°&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research workflow is enhanced by &lt;em&gt;reduced loops&lt;/em&gt;. Information processing and insight discovery are sped up. Not only Ardi helps reduce the cost of research process, but also unlocks the doors to verbalised knowledge for progressive communication and creation.üòä&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MuseoPic Analytics&amp;colon; museology revamped!</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Museum curators spend a lot of time and effort in organising an exhibition. Once it is launched, they are often already on the go again for the next one and have little time to optimise current show. How can we help them &lt;em&gt;get the most out of every exhibition?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;e-iframe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/48McP4qGOJU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;backdrop&quot;&gt;Backdrop&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.museopic.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MuseoPic&lt;/a&gt; is a smartphoen application which enhances ordinary museum visits. Through &lt;em&gt;augmented reality&lt;/em&gt;, visitors can interact with exhibits, learn more about their story behind, and create their own collections. It has been deployed in contemporary art, design, and natural sciences museums in üá´üá∑Lyon areas&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MuseoPic Analytics captures visitors‚Äô interaction with exhibits and &lt;em&gt;transform that data into useful insights&lt;/em&gt; for museum personnel, so that they can easily understand their current programme‚Äôs performance &amp;amp; settings, and make adaptation right away. This help them better align exhibitions with their visitors, raise discoverability and engagement, maximise üéübox office sales as well as ‚≠êÔ∏èpublic reviews, and better develop content management and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;o-grid&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;o-grid__col o-grid__col--2-4-m&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/museopic03a-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Interview analysis in progress&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;o-grid__col o-grid__col--2-4-m&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/museopic03b-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Workflow study&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hands-on&quot;&gt;Hands-on&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to better understand the organisation and typical workflow of museums, we conducted several &lt;em&gt;interviews with our target users&lt;/em&gt;, namely the museum directors, quality control attach√©s and content managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then analysed their actions and needs regarding the life cycle of exhibitions, extracted their &lt;em&gt;jobs-to-be-done (JTBDs)&lt;/em&gt;. We framed some major challenges &amp;amp; problems and mapped some üéàopportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;o-grid&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;o-grid__col o-grid__col--2-4-m&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/museopic04a-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;In situ feedback&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/museopic04b-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mock-up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the evolution of ideas, we clustered them in &lt;em&gt;use case scenarios&lt;/em&gt;. We actively involved our users and stakeholders for comments and feedback while iterating our design cycles to create &lt;em&gt;mock-ups for the analytics platform&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end of our partnership, we packaged our findings and handed off our prototypes with UX strategy advice to our client.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>&amp;lsquo;Stronger together&amp;rsquo;&amp;colon; A diverse mosaic</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;backdrop&quot;&gt;Backdrop&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, I participated again in the annual &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lisboanarua.com/blog/2018/02/15/esta-aberto-concurso-sardinhas-festas-lisboa-2018/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Concurso Sardinhas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; organised by &lt;i&gt;Empresa de Gest√£o de Equipamentos e Anima√ß√£o Cultural&lt;/i&gt; in celebration of &lt;i&gt;Festa de Lisboa&lt;/i&gt;. This yearly contest consists of making art in the form of sardine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;concept&quot;&gt;Concept&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I had the idea from the aminal nature of sardine‚Äî‚Äî&lt;em&gt;forage fish&lt;/em&gt;. In the ocean, sardines swim together in schools. They usuallly form a big group of fish to move around.üêüüê† Of course deep down they are all different individuals. But together they are stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with the idea of &lt;em&gt;immitating a child‚Äôs drawing&lt;/em&gt; fish in different colours. I then continued by exploring the combination of colours and the forms of representing sardines. I further tried bringing different sizes, thicknesses, positions, and postures of each together. I concluded on to the style of &lt;em&gt;üñåAsian paintbrush&lt;/em&gt; to represent their form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fun/sardinhas18-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Draft 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fun/sardinhas18-02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Draft 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, all the individually unique sardines formed a beautiful, lively &lt;em&gt;mosaic&lt;/em&gt; of themselves. &lt;strong&gt;Together they are one!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>&amp;lsquo;Danse des sardines &amp;ndash; printemps&amp;rsquo;&amp;colon; sardines dancing with Spring</title>

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fun/sardinhas17-07-gh.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sardines dancing with Spring&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-season-to-celebrate&quot;&gt;A season to celebrate&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I participated in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lisboanarua.com/festasdelisboa/2017/05/24/sardinhas-vencedoras-2017/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Concurso Sardinhas 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; organised by &lt;i&gt;Empresa de Gest√£o de Equipamentos e Anima√ß√£o Cultural&lt;/i&gt; in celebration of &lt;i&gt;Festa de Lisboa&lt;/i&gt;. This yearly contest consists of making art in the form of sardine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;concept&quot;&gt;Concept&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by cutting spaces within the given sardine silhoutte template. I then had the idea of morphing these spaces and forms into a &lt;em&gt;ballerina&lt;/em&gt;, dancing to celebrate the festival of Lisbon. I played with hiding multiple sardines on the ballerina. I then smoothened the contours and tried adding mild and, later, vivid colours to the spaces with reference to &lt;em&gt;colouring books&lt;/em&gt; for children and &lt;em&gt;stained glass windows&lt;/em&gt; of churches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sardines became a ballerina, the ballerina became Spring. üôÇ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fun/sardinhas17-loop-gh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Development of sardine - Spring&quot; id=&quot;h-600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagining that children could play with this colouring template, for making this colour model more &lt;em&gt;accessible&lt;/em&gt; to children with sight conditions, when the illustration/graphics are passed to greyscale, the ballerina can be still obviously seen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;challenge&quot;&gt;Challenge&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an academic project to design and build a chair within 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to explore the possibilities of a single, continuous line in relation with a chair; whether we could form &lt;em&gt;a stable, sitting surface with only one line&lt;/em&gt;, while maintaining the aesthetic of its simplicity, standing its functional purposes, and satisfying the comfort of sitter(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fun/linear01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exploring the possibilities to form a sitting surface from one simple line on isometric paper.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hands-on&quot;&gt;Hands-on&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an extensive research into physics, ergonomics and aethetics, simulation prototyping and testing were conducted. I concluded on to one design for building the final chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chair consists of two pieces of components: a &lt;em&gt;steel frame&lt;/em&gt; in the form of a continuous line, and a &lt;em&gt;wooden plank&lt;/em&gt; which could be laid on top to easily form a sitting surface. The sitting surface is elongated and designed to, for üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èone person, support both sitting and leaning, with an ergonormically curved armrest/back; the strength of the material would also allow üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏ètwo persons to sit on top of it at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fun/linear02.png&quot; alt=&quot;3D model showing the ergonomically curved armrest/back with measurements.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;o-grid&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fun/linear03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3D model showing the ergonomically curved armrest/back with measurements.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;o-grid__col o-grid__col--2-4-m&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fun/linear04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3D model showing the chair from the front view.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with iron and steel specialists and carpenters in their ateliers and workshops and realised the &lt;em&gt;1-to-1 chair prototype&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chair was tested and approved by peer students of the furniture design class as well as professors of the faculty.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Carnot&amp;colon; where pedagogy researchers &amp; teachers meet</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;objective&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institut Carnot de l‚Äô√âducation is an academic consortium of the region Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes, France. It connects pedagogy researchers and education practicioners to &lt;em&gt;favour exchange and cooperation&lt;/em&gt; between them. The goal is to combine scientific knowledge and practical experiences to encourage innovation in the üéìFrench education system, so that academic practices (both teaching and research) can become &lt;em&gt;adapted to contemporary social issues&lt;/em&gt; (such as premature dropouts, regional segregation &amp;amp; social mobility) and eventually help solve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;study&quot;&gt;Study&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To effectively bring researchers and teachers together, we need to &lt;em&gt;üïµüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èunderstand the nuances&lt;/em&gt; of interest fields and expertise in Education Sciences. How can we verbalise them? How can we make sure their problems are discoverable to other professionals in the sector? How might we best enhance contact between common groups and promote collaboration? How might we streamline their proposals with funding schemes from the Ministries of Education and Research? How might we trampoline projects with local authorities, institutions and universities?ü§î&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hands-on&quot;&gt;Hands-on&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We approached and interviewed different profiles of target users: researchers, educators, directors of institutions, moderators of Institut Carnot, and sponsors from the ministries. We walked through their &lt;em&gt;typical workflow&lt;/em&gt; and identified their &lt;em&gt;needs, pain points and üîÆwishes&lt;/em&gt;. We analysed their contact points along how a collaborative project is usually rolled out, and explored how the online platform can smoothen their interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pinned our ideas down to &lt;em&gt;prototyping&lt;/em&gt; the online platform &lt;em&gt;interface&lt;/em&gt;, further through üß™testing, feedback loops and üîÑiteration. We extended our study to promotion and invitation of collaborators on Institut Carnot‚Äôs project. In the end, we handed over our prototype accompanied by a strategy report.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MesInfos&amp;colon; my data, my hut!</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As digital services emerge, every day we create a huge amount of data across various providers.üì±üíª‚åöÔ∏èüì° Yet, we don‚Äôt know what has been written on our names behind their gates. Why are we‚Äî‚Äîthe data generators‚Äî‚Äî&lt;em&gt;kept in the dark from our own data&lt;/em&gt; footprints online?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;e-iframe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Wh8HMRKP4U?&amp;amp;cc_load_policy=1&amp;amp;cc_lang_pref=en&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;goal&quot;&gt;Goal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the think tank &lt;a href=&quot;https://fing.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fondation Internet Nouvelle G√©n√©ration&lt;/a&gt; (la Fing) and we believe: &lt;em&gt;everyone shall be able to handle our own data, and make use of them for our own good!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of being locked up in companies‚Äô üîêcryptic servers, the data that we create daily ought to be provided back to us; they should be as worthy and useful to the individuals as to the companies. üí™üèº&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/mesinfos03-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Visualising Cozy Cloud's architecture.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;dive-in&quot;&gt;Dive in&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cozy.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cozy Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source, privacy by design, self-hosting ready storage architecture originated from France. We collaborated with their developers to &lt;em&gt;comprehend&lt;/em&gt; the functioning of a smart, personal data hub and the intricacies in the connectors and &lt;em&gt;data models&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the types of information and data generated in a contemporary digital daily life. That includes ‚òéÔ∏ètelecom bills, üí∞banking entries, ‚ö°Ô∏èenergy usage, üöãtrasport expenditure, important papers such as üìúinsurances, as well as üì∏üñºmultimedia input as familiar as our smartphones and üìäactivity trackers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hands-on&quot;&gt;Hands-on&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand how we can &lt;em&gt;maximise the potentials of ‚Äòself data‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;, we conducted user research to probe into the handling of personal data of dissimilar profiles, analysed their pain points and the missing hinges. We sought the possibilities to &lt;em&gt;improve their individual digital management&lt;/em&gt; and address their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/mesinfos-personas-scenarios.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Personas and use case scenarios&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After mapping user concerns against the platform‚Äôs status quo, we ideated how we can &lt;em&gt;convert functions as added values&lt;/em&gt; through Cozy Cloud as its unique selling points. We crystalised our findings in &lt;em&gt;use cases and personas&lt;/em&gt;. Through an iterative process, we &lt;em&gt;wireframed new functions&lt;/em&gt; for the platform and collected feedback from different stakeholders. In the end of our partnership, we presented over our &lt;a href=&quot;https://invis.io/9UBH1AVTG#/231254425_1-accueil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/a&gt; to Cozy Cloud &amp;amp; la Fing, pitched some further concepts, handed over an advisory report and a vision road map for subsequent development of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/mesinfos-USP.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;What makes Cozy Cloud unique? We stressed on what added values each function can bring to the users.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ComPASS&amp;colon; global co-working, aligned direction</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborative work can be tough when you do not share the same vision‚Ä¶ especially when you are &lt;em&gt;5,000+ altogether across the world!?&lt;/em&gt; üåéüåçüåè&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;status-quo&quot;&gt;Status quo&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T√úV Rheinland is a 145-year-old-and-growing certification service provider for all kinds of technical standards, ranging from üß∏baby toys to üöúheavy machinery. It holds offices worldwide and work with test centres and laboratories across continents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To guarantee quality and security, products are examined and tested comprehensively at T√úV, often at the best situations in different üë®üèª‚Äçüî¨regional labs. Hence, &lt;em&gt;delegation, coordination &amp;amp; management&lt;/em&gt; between divisions are crucial to their success and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/tuev-compass-globar-cowork.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scattered locations and unaligned workflow makes global coordination difficult&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But protocols and concensus do not always come naturally. Departments have developed their unique ways of work over time. A &lt;em&gt;shared standard work tool&lt;/em&gt; along the international production becomes necessary to bring people and work together. üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;concept&quot;&gt;Concept&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs how ComPASS came to live! ComPASS is a &lt;em&gt;workflow platform&lt;/em&gt; tailor-made for T√úV‚Äôs global business. It accompanies their various teams through thier production process and &lt;em&gt;üß≠provide orientation&lt;/em&gt; to players on complex proejcts. From order placement &amp;amp; analysis, labour division &amp;amp; cooperation, to lab tests, reports &amp;amp; follow-ups‚Äî‚Äîevery pace is incorporated and taken care of on ComPASS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/tuev-compass-alignment.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scattered locations and unaligned workflow makes global coordination difficult&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hands-on&quot;&gt;Hands-on&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met with their international business and technical departments to conduct &lt;em&gt;üîçuser research&lt;/em&gt;. By understanding and analysing their process and roles, we discovered insights in how to &lt;em&gt;digitise, innovate and reshape their global workflow&lt;/em&gt;. We tried to, as well, tactically find the common ground for geographical &lt;em&gt;work culture &amp;amp; habits&lt;/em&gt;. This led us to a flexible, scalable system which not only consolidates their business as a whole, but also tones in well with different team players across the board. ‚õπüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚õπüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work in an &lt;em&gt;intercontinental dual-track agile team&lt;/em&gt; across seven locations: üáØüáµYokohama, üá≠üá∞Hong Kong, üá®üá≥Shanghai, üáπüáºTaipei, üá¨üáßLondon, üá©üá™Nuremberg, and üá©üá™Cologne. We take care of the exploration and insight discovery, as well as guaranteeing end product delivery. Altogether we are building the ComPASS platform and simultaneously &lt;em&gt;developing a design system&lt;/em&gt; for T√úV Rheinland for their other forthcoming digital products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/tuev-compass-design-system.png&quot; alt=&quot;Design system for T√úV Rheinland&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Higher transparency&lt;/em&gt; along the global pipeline, &lt;em&gt;better management &amp;amp; coordination&lt;/em&gt; of working teams, &lt;em&gt;closer collaboration&lt;/em&gt; between business &amp;amp; technical departments‚Äî‚Äîall towards a &lt;strong&gt;stronger service provision, catalysing customer satisfaction&lt;/strong&gt;. üòÑüß≠&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bikespector&amp;colon; shared bikes prediction</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I count on my shared bike?üö≤&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared mobility is good for urban dwellers. You don‚Äôt need a bike (or car) if you just want to get from A to B. Sharing bikes saves us the money and the worry of losing one. But since everyone can take and go at any moment, it is &lt;em&gt;hard to rely on shared bikes&lt;/em&gt; to plan your trip. Besides, what if it suddenly rains?‚õà&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/bikespector-shared-bikes-timetable.png&quot; alt=&quot;Can we have a service timetable for shared bikes?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;concept&quot;&gt;Concept&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared bikes being a means of transport, we believe hirers should be given something more tangible to depend on, like a üöámetro or üöåbus &lt;em&gt;timetable&lt;/em&gt;; and that should also take account of other factors which can affect its service, like üå§weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If shared bikes are as volatile as weather, can we &lt;em&gt;forecast&lt;/em&gt; them with what we know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/bikespector-machine-learning.png&quot; alt=&quot;If shared bikes are as volatile as weather, can we forecast them with what we know?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hands-on&quot;&gt;Hands-on&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made use of the &lt;em&gt;open data&lt;/em&gt; of shared bikes in Cologne, Berlin, D√ºsseldorf and Frankfurt. Together with &lt;em&gt;weather&lt;/em&gt; data, we studied the &lt;em&gt;coorelation&lt;/em&gt; between them while aiming at predicting bikes availability around a given address for the upcoming hours and days. Through the course of the analysis, this has been translated into ü§©&lt;em&gt;forecasting free shared bikes&lt;/em&gt; around a point‚Äî‚Äîwithin a preferred walking distance‚Äî‚Äîfor the next hour up to 5 days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with data specialists, we built a data model and applied machine learning methods. Over time, our model got trained to purify its &lt;em&gt;prediction accuracy&lt;/em&gt;. We have been able to attain as high as &lt;em&gt;84%&lt;/em&gt;.‚úÖ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we developed an intereactive interface to &lt;em&gt;visualise&lt;/em&gt; our bike prediction data and turned it into a serviceable tool open to public.&lt;br /&gt;
üëâüèº&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bikespector.de&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Check it out!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now shared bikes users can &lt;em&gt;better count&lt;/em&gt; on their &lt;em&gt;local bike hire&lt;/em&gt; as a proper means of transport, and plan their trips with shared bikes in and around the city. &lt;strong&gt;Shared mobility made reliable!&lt;/strong&gt; üòéüö≤‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are we indeed smart, or foolisher than we think?</title>
        <description>&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move fast and break things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs (in-)famous motto for design and management process: to disrupt existing normality, to get rid of unnecessary formalities and red tape, to deliver faster to the hands of customers. This ideology sounds enticing and may be pertinent to keeping processes and management lean. It has been supported by the proliferation of start-ups. Nevertheless, being fast and breaking things does not guarantee a good outcome all the time. &lt;em&gt;Being fast pushes us to&lt;/em&gt; process fast; processing fast invites us to jump steps; jumping steps risks &lt;em&gt;committing mistakes&lt;/em&gt;‚Äî‚Äîsometimes unnecessary, consequential, and unmendable ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid breaking dishes (and perhaps a product/brand/company‚Äôs reputation and people‚Äôs trust in return), we might have to slow down at times‚Äî‚Äîespecially at crucial moments when we make decisions and/or judgement calls. &lt;em&gt;We would have to acknowledge our limits and wisely cope with them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what &lt;i&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/i&gt; by Daniel Kahneman is about: understanding the limits of our mind, acknowledge them in our thinking, and wisely cope with them as they happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below I am going to unfold some of my highlights from the book related to my profession as an Experience Designer. I warn you: it is looooong. &lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; is here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are lazy in thinking. Most of the time, we just follow our ‚Äòinstinct‚Äô.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We only know what is available for us to know. The unknown can affect (hugely) what we are evaluating, judging, and designing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We circumvent complicated problems by answering easier, relatable questions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are prone to what we are used to believing. Taking action simply based on our beliefs can adhere us further (only) to them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experience does not mean memory, vice versa. Which one are you talking about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;0-how-do-we-think&quot;&gt;0. How do we think?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/Thinking-00.png&quot; alt=&quot;Two systems of thinking: fast car and slow, sleepy turtle.&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At ground zero, Kahneman points out that there are two distinct thinking systems in our minds. &lt;em&gt;‚ÄòSystem 1‚Äô is mostly autonomous and capable of making fast, intuitive decisions.&lt;/em&gt; It is partly rooted in our evolutionary instinct and, to a certain extent, developed through the years from how we experience and learn about the world. &lt;em&gt;‚ÄòSystem 2‚Äô is the slower counterpart. It monitors System 1 and is capable of producing deliberate thoughts.&lt;/em&gt; By default, it is idle, remains comparatively dormant, and requires effort to wake it up. These two systems coexist and spontaneously interfere with each other without us becoming aware of such an occurrence. In the book, Kahneman analyses the interrelations between the two systems. Examples about cognition and thinking procedures are in plenty and well detailed to aid in discerning the intricacies of their correlation. Here are a few tricky discoveries of cognitive biases, which can apply to the Design &amp;amp; Research environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-what-you-see-is-all-there-is&quot;&gt;1. ‚ÄòWhat you see is all there is.‚Äô&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!--- Use &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; instead of p &gt; img ---&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/Thinking-01.png&quot; alt=&quot;WYSIATI: what you see is all there is; what you don't see is all there is not.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;extras&quot;&gt;
    WYSIATI: what you see is all there is; what you don't see is all there is not.
    &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our decisions are based on our judgements. Our judgements are based on our understanding. Our understanding is based on our perception. And our perception is based on what there is‚Äî‚Äîin front and around us‚Äî‚Äîthe discoverable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;em&gt;we know the things we‚Äôve learnt of; and we do not know what we have not.&lt;/em&gt; Hence, when we have to make decisions and judgements about something beyond what we know, we turn back to what we have learnt and memories of how we‚Äôve applied it. We search through our experiences and weigh our options against what we have lived through and believe. We seek to correlate fragments to form our current understanding of dos and don‚Äôts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a lot more than what we know, beyond our understanding, beyond our awareness, and even just beyond the discoverable (e.g. until the current time). Of course, you may look up online or in books when you have some necessary clues as to what you‚Äôre missing. But when these clues are not in our vision, we simply won‚Äôt know them or their impact on the subject matter and the decision at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may observe a wilting and yellowing plant and link it to your understanding that it may have been under-watered. Not until you learn that it could be a symptom of rot roots or bound roots would you enquire into its bottom soil. And all this very likely has started to happen before you can even see the plant wilt. Similarly, you may observe a drop in sales in your smartphone product line and begin to look back in history how products and their sales figures were revamped. You may well infer that making a trendier and fancier look for the next generation would help restore its desirability. But not until you realise that your customers have turned to durability and sustainable ethics can you take the right track towards a proper solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-we-replace-complex-problems&quot;&gt;2. We replace complex problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!--- Use &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; instead of p &gt; img ---&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/Thinking-02.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hmm‚Ä¶ let's just take the shorter route! Wait, have we already?&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;extras&quot;&gt;
    Hmm‚Ä¶ let's just take the shorter route! Wait, have we already?
    &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we are dealing with complex problems, Kahneman points out that we often dodge them by &lt;em&gt;replacing them with simpler, more straightforward questions&lt;/em&gt;, answering the substitutes, and then pretending to have resolved the original ones. This swapping mechanism is so automated and rooted in our thinking that we do not even notice it when we have performed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take an example: You just relaunched a website, and you want to assess how great your website is. You approach some visitors and ask them whether your new website is great. While they may tell you they like the new fresh look or they prefer the old one, and point out all the wows and ewws, they might have already been answering the substitute question ‚ÄòDo I like this new website?‚Äô, instead of ‚ÄòIs this new website great?‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To really evaluate whether your new website is great or not, you might have to guide yourself through a few criteria and metrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does it allow better information access (usability)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does it offer more engaging storytelling (branding)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does it drive better e-commerce conversion (sales)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does it satisfy a broader coverage of use cases for all visitor profiles (accessibility)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does it load faster on poor Internet connection (performance)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, you are determining whether it better fulfils your original objectives than the old website, and/or whether it attains higher scores in the parameters that you measure. Thus, it is crucial to trace qualitative feedback back to where they come from, to what they are really addressing; and then compare whether and how much they are in line with your assessment before jumping into conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-we-create-illusion-to-validate-what-we-believe&quot;&gt;3. We create illusion to validate what we believe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!--- Use &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; instead of p &gt; img ---&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/Thinking-03.png&quot; alt=&quot;The more it seems complete, the more you believe it is correct.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;extras&quot;&gt;
    The more it seems complete, the more you believe it is correct.
    &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we think, not only are our minds lazy and prone to inertia, limited in scope, and erratic along the route, what‚Äôs more is that our mind is also delusive regarding the basis on which we think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book, Kahneman has cited many cases about experts failing their own expertise. The situation is intriguing to study. The objective discovery from this is that &lt;em&gt;our beliefs&lt;/em&gt;‚Äî‚Äîthe collection of good-and-bads through experiences, and the pedestal of current judgements and decisions‚Äî‚Äî&lt;em&gt;are not often based on facts; but rather on stories and their coherence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we hear a story, we evaluate whether the story makes sense, whether it sounds plausible. The further we listen, we analyse whether the information is consistent‚Äî‚Äîconsistent with the idea conveyed, consistent with what we were told before‚Äî‚Äîand maybe whether the interlinkages sound admissible. The more complete the story is, the more plausible it appears to us. If nothing raises concern to our guard (System 2), we do not necessarily attempt to seek whether what we are hearing/seeing is true; we do not verify it by reflex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is particularly dangerous as how social media and partisan (at times fake) news have demonstrated. The former gradually sets us into our own bubble through (micro-)profiling; the latter creeps in and reinforces the echoes in the chamber. The more resounding a story seems, the more we may believe it; the more we interact with the things we believe, the more we tend to get profiled as interested in that topic; thus the more we get shown that content‚Ä¶ Echoing algorithms and potential dogmatism in short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As designers, how can we help solve this problem? How can we help people step out of their chamber? How can we prevent polarising communities and help people discover pluralities in perspectives and opinions? These problems are nothing new, but counteractive measures continue to fall short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unravelling these puzzles would require better initiatives from involved groups as collectives (designers + developers, content creators + visitors + media regulators, business managers + entrepreneurs + legal bodies, ‚Ä¶) to undertake a closer, introspective collaboration for dissolving our illusions of verities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-we-do-not-tell-the-same-experience-as-we-experience-it&quot;&gt;4. We do not tell the same experience as we experience it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!--- Use &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; instead of p &gt; img ---&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/Thinking-04.png&quot; alt=&quot;Believe it or not: we can find it more pleasant to slowly walk out of pain instead of stopping abruptly at once!&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;extras&quot;&gt;
    Believe it or not: we can find it more pleasant to slowly walk out of pain instead of stopping abruptly at once!
    &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, what makes our mind more complicated is the construction of scenes which we underwent inside our head‚Äî‚Äîcalled memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we recall an experience, we do not necessarily paint the same picture as to how we experienced it. This is not about accusing us of a lying nature, but rather about the &lt;em&gt;deviation in the image we create relative to how we truly lived the event&lt;/em&gt;. And through establishing this image (later as memory) in our mind, which we will remember over time and tell, we neglect the details to a certain extent and change the overall scenery inscribed in our head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be on a holiday. Everything is pleasant and fine. Until the point where you lose your wallet and your experience takes a 180 Ãä turn into a frantic nightmare. Later on, when your friends ask how your holiday was, your narration will very likely be dominated by the peak moment of the holiday (unfortunately your lost wallet) and how it ended. Your memory of this holiday would very probably also be affected by the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kahneman explains that &lt;em&gt;memory&lt;/em&gt; (the mental notation of how something happened) &lt;em&gt;is symbolised by the peak and the end of an experience.&lt;/em&gt; Other details tend to wane when we are reporting the occurrence. Besides, the amount of time in total matters little when we gauge it in hindsight. Our retrospective evaluation of an event can almost be summarised by the average of the most sensational moment and the end of the entire encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It opens up a big question for Experience Design: What are we actually designing for? Are we designing for a better in situ experience as we live it at the very moment, or are we designing for a better memory of the experience afterwards? The real situation may be less philosophical than the question appears. The best is to maximise both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you file a tax declaration online, the interface should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convey security and confidentiality when you are using it (experience security);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable you to get yourself through the filing process without too much doubt (experience ease); and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offer less hassle than paper and pen‚Äî‚Äîand quick (experience convenience)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can offer you detailed explanations of all the form fields through your preparation for the tax declaration. In this way, you may experience ease from the platform when using it, as you have never been provided such clear guidance and pinged by so few doubts. However, this will probably lengthen your preparation before you can submit your file because it now consumes your attention and patience at every granular level. You would not experience convenience. It might even give rise to a repelling sensation within your quick-to-associate mind, that this platform is the devil of bureaucracy incarnate. You would detest this platform and label it in your memory as ‚Äònever use again‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tricky is the way we think, trickier than we know it and are aware of it. There are many more unfamiliar bizarreries in our minds, side tracks and loopholes in our thinking. To really understand the limits of our cognitive process so as to acknowledge and better cope with them, I invite you to read Kahnemann‚Äôs book itself! üòâ You will very likely discover the commonly overlooked mistakes/biases related to your own field/practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To recap:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are lazy in thinking. Most of the time, we just follow our ‚Äòinstinct‚Äô.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We only know what is available for us to know. The beyond can affect what we are evaluating, judging, and deciding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We circumvent complicated problems by tackling easier, relatable issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are prone to what we are used to believing. Actions taken simply based on our beliefs can make our grip further tenacious.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experience does not mean memory, vice versa. Which one are you talking about?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to make classical art appealing to young people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the celebration of the 500&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday of üë®üèª‚Äçüé®Jacopo Tintoretto, Italian Renaissance artist, we &lt;em&gt;remixed classial paintings with visual recognition &amp;amp; augmented reality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;992&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;source src=&quot;http://www.pipipi.de/fileadmin/dam/awards/tintoretto2go/tintoretto2go_master_mp4_en_klein_2.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;concept&quot;&gt;Concept&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tintoretto2Go, we &lt;em&gt;hijacked advertisements&lt;/em&gt; around the city of Cologne and Berlin by replacing them with first-class paintings. üíéHidden gems in these artworks were spotlit with &lt;em&gt;animated 3D modelling in AR&lt;/em&gt;, letting the public relive the spectacles of the grand classic. What‚Äôs more? We hid them all around the city and updated every week‚Äî‚Äîit‚Äôs the &lt;em&gt;treasure hunt in neighbourhoods&lt;/em&gt; and in the streets!üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüïµüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è No matter if you unlock all of them or not, it guides you to explore Wallraf-Richartz Museum‚Äôs special exhibition ‚ÄòTintoretto‚Äî‚ÄîA Star was Born‚Äô in the end, and offers you a discount to the museum if you find them all!‚ú®&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/tintoretto-storyboard-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Storyboard for Tintoretto2Go, narratives of Renaissance masterpiece&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hands-on&quot;&gt;Hands-on&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with literature review in different languages and expert interviews, we found out the highlights in the üñºlicensed paintings and created &lt;em&gt;compelling storytelling&lt;/em&gt; out from the artworks. We consolidated the narratives and produced üååstoryboards, consulted the museum curator and gathered feedback, before we went into 3D modelling/animation and development with the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, we tested our prototype and further improved our üëægame experience. Every week we updated the visual markers to enhance the city hunt amusement. üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/tintoretto-test-compressed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;On-site testing for AR storytelling&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition was held in Cologne Oct 2017‚ÄìJan 2018. As many as &lt;em&gt;99,062 visitors&lt;/em&gt; have found their way into Wallraf-Richartz Museum, exceeding all expectations! üé™&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are very pleased about the enthusiasm with which our Tintoretto exhibition was received by such a broad audience. The spectrum ranged from young people interested in art to avid Tintoretto lovers to experienced specialists from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jubilee exhibition was later hosted in Mus√©e du Luxembourg in üá´üá∑Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SnowRec&amp;colon; connected ski camp</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;challenge&quot;&gt;Challenge&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IoT for winter sport&lt;/em&gt;, how can the Internet of things be applied to innovate winter sport?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/snowrec02b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SnowRec&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;study&quot;&gt;Study&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first started with brainstorming the AEIOU of ‚òÉÔ∏èwinter sport: activities, environments, interactions, objects, and users. We soon recognise the big IoT problem for winter sport: thick clothes, thick gloves, thick googles‚Äî‚Äîall but &lt;em&gt;obstacles for the use of touch-based digital products&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some research, we found out that families in ski resort usually send their children to ski classes during the day. We pinned down the use of IoT to maximising such learning experience whilst bringing its outcome back to the üè°üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶family. Boom! A brand-new service is born: &lt;em&gt;connected ski camp with an online progress-tracking portal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/snowrec-storyboard-1440.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SnowRec ski camp, how it functions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;concept&quot;&gt;Concept&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ski tutors usually ask students to try skiing downhill individually before calling it a day. To document this rewarding moment, ski tutors can use their SnowRec goggles, which are equipped with a camera. By pressing on the large mechanical button or by vocal command, it starts to &lt;em&gt;üìπvideotape students‚Äô performance&lt;/em&gt; as the tutor follows him/her in vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/snowrec-mobile.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SnowRec mobile application&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera is connected to the tutor‚Äôs smartphone by Bluetooth. Recorded videos are sent directly to the SnowRec application. Class participants are automatically identified by &lt;em&gt;facial recognition&lt;/em&gt; or by the individual QR code printed on their vest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/snowrec-desktop.gif&quot; alt=&quot;SnowRec tablet/desktop portal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the application, the tutor can &lt;em&gt;evaluate students‚Äô performance&lt;/em&gt;, distribute üèÖaward badges, and publish videos. Parents and children can watch them later on SnowRec portal with the credentials received when they first signed up for the ski camp. Personal comments and learning curve can be found on their portal. Videos can be downloaded and shared to remote family members (üëãüèºhello grandpas &amp;amp; grandmas), too. üéâüíØ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/snowrec06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SnowRec mood board&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hands-on&quot;&gt;Hands-on&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How should SnowRec app-portal work then? We mapped &lt;em&gt;user journeys&lt;/em&gt; as we consider use cases from the ‚õ∑ski camp, through learning documentation, and to ‚ù§Ô∏èfamily shared moments. We considered how different users‚Äî‚Äîtutors, parents, and children‚Äî‚Äîmay interact with SnowRec portal. We scribbled a few &lt;em&gt;wireframes&lt;/em&gt; to test the flow, and further enriched it with a fun, motivating visual identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/snowrec07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SnowRec app-portal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made &lt;em&gt;click dummies&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vghtbq.axshare.com/#g=1&amp;amp;p=connexion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mobile&lt;/a&gt; for ski tutors‚Äô use case and on &lt;a href=&quot;https://xd.adobe.com/view/4ae14c76-5cb5-495d-9653-da3831bbe80a/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tablet &amp;amp; desktop&lt;/a&gt; for families‚Äô review. In the end, we also pitched our IoT ski camp at the art and design school &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lamartinierediderot.fr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;La Martini√®re Diderot&lt;/a&gt; and let our visitors try out the prototype‚Äî‚Äîthey loved it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chamrousse&amp;colon; Tourism Office remade!</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chamrousse Tourism Office website dates back to 2010. Its convoluted information architecture has made the access to alerts, promotional offers, facility information and activity plans lost in an enigmatic navigation; content scattered all around the site.üíÜüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/chamrousse02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chamrousse Tourism Office website from 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;study&quot;&gt;Study&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started with a &lt;em&gt;content audit&lt;/em&gt; and classified the types of information. We discerned scenarios &amp;amp; entry points to the website and analysed visitors‚Äô online journey. A &lt;em&gt;benchmark&lt;/em&gt; was carried out to compare competitors‚Äô market position and to &lt;em&gt;sharpen Chamrousse‚Äôs ‚ú®strategic selling points&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/chamrousse03-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Paper mock-ups for accommodation reservation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hands-on&quot;&gt;Hands-on&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After shuffling the architecture and standardising navigation paths, we produced quick and dirty paper mock-ups for testing our &lt;em&gt;üîÄuser flow&lt;/em&gt;. We iterated our design according to testers‚Äô feedback. We put ski resort visitors‚Äô concern to our highest priority, but also retained a seasonal touch for summer activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we refreshed Chamrousse Tourism Office‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;visual identity&lt;/em&gt; and their online interfaces, to give it a fresh, energetic yet calming look.üòÑ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/chamrousse04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Branding scheme&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created &lt;em&gt;wireframes &amp;amp; visual mock-ups&lt;/em&gt; for the new website, together with a analytical report on our design process and recommendations for their content management.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Modern Role of Journalism and News Media</title>
        <description>&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information is abundant and harsh these days. Everyone sounds like shouting, if not throttling, at each other. At least it is what it feels like when you read online. When you turn to newspapers or broadcast media, it does not seem much better either. Conflicts, wars, disasters, contradictory reports and opinions. It is confusing and you are in the middle of the entanglement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/CF19-Messy-Messy-Tribbles.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Messy, messy tribbles&quot; width=&quot;768px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;extras cap&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do you feel like messy tribbles raining over your head? (Image: &lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/star-trek-mess-tribbles-108KUzjTMEp2gw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Giphy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I attended the &lt;a href=&quot;https://campfirefestival.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Campfire Festival¬†2019&lt;/a&gt; in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. It is an event about the relation between journalism, media, human and the digital world. The talks were multidimensional, cross-disciplinary and inspiring. It made me ponder over the role of journalism and news media in our current time‚Äî‚Äîwhat and whom it is for‚Äî‚Äîand question its utility and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;extras&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a professional journalist. Comments here are, therefore, only from a regular newspaper reader, media watcher‚Äôs external point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;has-journalism-failed-itself&quot;&gt;Has journalism failed itself?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-journalism-for&quot;&gt;What is journalism for?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boundaries of journalism might be flexible. Its core function, nevertheless, remains conveying information&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; by extension, empowering the informed&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Journalism has long tasked itself with a civic role. It has the duty to monitor powers, to observe them, and to report information back to the public. It is even regarded as the Fourth Estate, to counter the executive, legislative and judicial powers. In a liberal society, it even holds higher goals to fulfil: to educate citizens, to foster their critical thinking, to provoke discussions and exchange of views and ideas‚Äî‚Äîso as to catalyse progress in society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-splintering-sector&quot;&gt;A splintering sector?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years we have observed a drop of confidence in traditional press. Distrust in news media is mounting. They are increasingly considered biased. ‚ÄòInformation is framed and presented only in ways which comply with their own stance.‚Äô Or even, ‚Äòjournalists are fabricating ‚Äúfake news‚Äù to influence public opinion and their actions‚Äô. These might have used to be just a few sparing, salty remarks, before politicians made them popular and now become more alarming. In Hanna Chalmers‚Äô report, the significance of the shift in media trustworthiness perception is highlighted. Traditional media (i.e. television, radio, newspapers and magazines) are generally respected by the public, as their entry barriers remain relatively high (e.g. expensive to produce, limited outlets). Nonetheless, their perceived reliability is tarnishing the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/CF19-Trust-Shift-Media.png&quot; alt=&quot;Trust-Shift-Media&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;extras cap&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Trust in print and broadcast generally slides in established media markets&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scepticism does not necessarily portray any falling quality amongst traditional news media. Instead, it reflects how their pillars might have been shaken by the dominant role of social media, where information circulates behind preference-fitting algorithms without (or with only few) gatekeepers. At the same time, digital platforms are sprouting while stories claiming to be news are blooming across the Internet. The abundance of partisan information can be overwhelming and can in turn undermine public confidence in the traditional press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-jinx-to-shun&quot;&gt;A jinx to shun?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scepticism is not the only endangering cause for journalism. Experiential avoidance (especially emotional) may weigh just as much. In a user research which I co-conducted during a journalism-remaking project, we found out that negativity infliction has become one of the causes why people reduce news consumption; or even avoiding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄòOpen the newspaper these days and all you see is troubles and chaos. It saddens you even more after a long day of work.‚Äô&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, journalism is not meant to put a smile on people‚Äôs face. (It should not either lest it regress to mere entertainment.) The heightening emotional barrier to get into news consumption, though, does pose a real threat. This menace is not only to the news media, but also further to our civic society and democracy. If people are avoiding news and numbing their senses by hiding behind their routine, journalism fails to inform the public with the happenings around them. It fails to bridge the people with their representative governing powers and to hold the authorities accountable. It fails to educate a dependable population of rational judgements. In such case, we fail to cater for an atmosphere of social intelligence and progress. We fail to maintain but jeopardise democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, it points to a genuine need for journalism and news media to react, to rethink how to invite the audience‚Äôs appetite for quality news consumption, to re-buff their own image and to reconsider their strategy for approaching the evolving public; or else it risks locking itself up in the ivory tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;revitalising-journalism&quot;&gt;Revitalising Journalism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revitalising journalism and news media sounds big. There are two apparent aspects which it can get started with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-of-the-people-for-the-people&quot;&gt;News of the people, for the people&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first aspect consists of reconnecting reader groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press and news media should not represent &lt;em&gt;the one voice&lt;/em&gt; they want to propagate, but &lt;em&gt;the voices&lt;/em&gt; which exist in the setting. It is understandable that journalists and media houses hold their own interest scope and standpoints. How news stories are followed, collected, analysed, cut, shaped, and presented to the public subsequently depends on them. Loss of information is inevitable during the production chain. Yet, instead of simply persuading the public of their perspective, the bigger picture should not be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Brexit as an example. Before the universal suffrage in 2016, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Raoldroyd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rachel Oldroyd&lt;/a&gt; presented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://sched.co/UBen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;her talk in Campfire Festival&lt;/a&gt;, Remain news media had overlooked the local voices and misjudged the proportion adhering to Leave. Coverage (especially analyses) for the other side was scarce. It was only until the ballots were counted that the public (and politicians) learnt‚Äî‚Äîin the hard way‚Äî‚Äîto have to deal with alternative voices seriously. Had they known more about the casting situation beforehand, the current deadlock situation of Brexit probably would have looked very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/CF19-Kids-in-zorbs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kids in zorbs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;extras cap&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are news media creating bubbles and putting us inside? (Image: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/bensutherland/4088676907/in/photostream/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ben Sutherland&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the social environment we live, we cannot simply strive for what we believe in without considering how the others would become. Similarly, journalists and media houses cannot only pin their words on own their stances and pretend to forget the rest. At times we might have overlooked: What matters for people? What is in their interest? What is at stake for communities and society? Or even for the country and the world? Journalism is not to segregate society but to objectively report what is happening; that should include giving speech to and shedding lights on all representable component parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to bring back the disregarded voices is to approach them closer. The key lies within connecting the fringes which construct us as a whole. Extract stories of the people and report the news back to them. Whilst media coverage is often centralised at the political, financial hubs, revamping local press and giving speech back to the forgotten communities would be pertinent to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;journalism-for-solutions&quot;&gt;Journalism for solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second aspect is about the journalistic role in problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current time is arguably not the best in which we would have hoped to be living. Open the window, we feel global warming and its associated climate issues (a solid emergency, by the way). Go to a supermarket or a restaurant, we are reminded of the unfairness that our food industry has instigated to our animal pals. Flip the newspaper, we are instantaneously confronted with all the swamping chaos we ought to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Internet and all the communication technologies, information can flow more freely and become readily available in our age. Journalism, as one of the channels, undoubtedly help us learn and understand the world. It also makes us realise, however, how disarrayed the world we live in is; and, at times, how little we seem to be capable of changing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a duty for the press to report happenings to the public, be it cheery or disheartening. Still, we should not forget, as a higher goal, journalism is to provoke thinking, better judgements, discussions and eventually social progress. If knowing the facts is the step no. 1 (journalism), and understanding how complexities are formed and interrelated is the step no. 2 (investigative journalism), estimating what sorts of solutions could be applied would sensibly be the step no. 3 (constructive journalism). Journalists have been steadily monitoring how the world evolves. They have the expertise in analogising events and comparing solutions across the globe and time. They could make use of their broad vision and intellectuality to mirror possible, practicable solutions which have happened elsewhere&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Instead of simply throwing cold, hard facts at readers‚Äô face, news press and media could guide the public towards solutions and consequently encourage advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/CF19-This-Is-Fine.gif&quot; alt=&quot;This is fine&quot; width=&quot;768px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;extras cap&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Knowing the facts is step¬†1; understanding the complexities is step¬†2; solving problems is step¬†3. (Image: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gph.is/2h8wI3B&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Giphy&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/0oBx7Jg4m-o&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adult Swim&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalism is supposed to help us understand the world and to empower us to make better judgements. Its ultimate function is to engage people‚Äôs conscience in action and to stimulate social improvements. The audience of today are turning doubtful of its authenticity and becoming bewildered amidst the concurrent intricacies. Journalists are, hence, in the most critical position ever to connect with the people, to converge crowds of different opinions on the round table, to objectively lay down all sides of the truth, and to supply the public with quality references, in the hope of steering the group towards resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Global Service Jam 2019&amp;colon; Do you even space-travel?</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;gsj-2019&quot;&gt;GSJ 2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was the annual &lt;a href=&quot;http://globaljams.org/jam/globalservicejam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global Service Jam¬†2019&lt;/a&gt;. I attended the local event in Cologne. It was so much fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.service-design-network.org/events/cologne-service-jam-2019&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GSJ in Cologne&lt;/a&gt; was organised by the local &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.service-design-network.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Service Design Network&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.denkwerk.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;denkwerk&lt;/a&gt; (Many thanks to Cristine and Ko for their facilitation!). The theme set globally for all jammers was ‚Äòblue‚Äô. Yes, &lt;em&gt;blue&lt;/em&gt;, fairly abstract, isn‚Äôt it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started with a quick round of co-brainstorming about everything we could think &lt;em&gt;out of the blue&lt;/em&gt;‚Äî‚Äîsky, water, summer, sad, Europe‚Ä¶ We thought onwards and gradually found out problems we wanted to address. Then we swiftly talked about them and transformed them into how-might-we challenges. Everyone got to pick up one with which they would like to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs how I boarded the ship of &lt;em&gt;space travel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sustainability&lt;/em&gt; for my weekend with Maxime and Nils. üòäüßîüèºüë±üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüöÄ‚ú®&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sustainable-space-travel&quot;&gt;Sustainable Space Travel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How might we foster sustainable space travel? Very hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, we dug out our assumptions. Who would be space-travelling? What could be the challenges of space travel? To what kinds of opportunity could space travel lead? We wanted to know more about how people actually think of space travel and whether our assumptions were correct. We built a space survey and took to the street to talk to passers-by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/GSJ19-Space-Survey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;When was the last time you travelled to outer space? Last week, surfing around Saturn!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;extras cap&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When was the last time you travelled to outer space? Last week, surfing around Saturn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To our surprise, people were actually quite engaged in talking to us about space travel. We found out that, in general, they think space travel is cool. They reckon it allows them to discover new matters, watch the dazzling stars and planets, obtain brand-new resources, and even make friends with aliens. In short, they believe it is a life-changing experience. But at the same time, they also fear that they would miss our planet Earth‚Äî‚Äîtheir family and friends, the fresh air, the flowers and the trees, and all the yummy delicacies (Ramen! üçúüç•). Some expressed that, instead of travelling to space, we should use the resources to solve existing issues on Earth, such as pollution and humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the difficulty, we think it is cool to let people experience travelling to outer space. The pretty view of Earth from space would be worth it. More importantly, though, it was essential to let them know that, far out in the universe, there are probably no other planets as lovely as our only Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;space-travel-time&quot;&gt;Space Travel Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we prototype space travel? We came up with the idea of letting people fly to space and see how planet Earth (currently) is. We built a paper prototype to simulate the space travel experience. More precisely, we condensed the travel journey to the most iconic and rewarding scene‚Äî‚Äîwatching the sunrise on Earth from outer space. We then went to the streets once again to ask people to space-travel with us. They were thrilled!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;o-grid&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;o-grid__col o-grid__col--2-4-m&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/GSJ19-Space-Game-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DIY space travel¬†‚Äì all hands on!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;o-grid__col o-grid__col--2-4-m&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/GSJ19-Space-Game-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Asking people to space-travel with us in the street.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing the sunrise on the pretty planet Earth, we asked them questions what they like the most on Earth and talked about their latest enjoyable experiences. Meanwhile, we added a few typical problems on Earth‚Äî‚Äîpollution, wars, representations of apathy, etc. We asked them to look at the Earth again and questioned them how they feel. A bit soured and moved, our space travellers opened up and shared more thoughts with us. They are aware of these situations, and are not content with them. They want change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/GSJ19-Feedback.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Collecting feedback from all the co-jammers.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went back to our jam base to think about how we could proceed with our concept. We further sharpened and reframed our challenge question into ‚ÄòHow might we create a love-Earth moment, through space-travelling, for people who are less aware of happenings in the world?‚Äô We presented our workflow and findings to our fellow jammers and collected some helpful feedback and inspiration. We pondered and pondered. In the end, we came up with the idea of‚Ä¶ a space trap!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;space-trap&quot;&gt;Space Trap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to use simulations for our stirring space travel experience. We nailed down our profile group to the self-absorbed, egocentric rich kids (just because they could space-travel the most; but extensible to greater public), who are not very aware of the happening of the rest of the world. We wanted to let them enjoy the cool, life-changing experience. We also wanted to teach them to love planet Earth and one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our concept was, when they sign up for space travel, they will be put in the simulation room without knowing. They will undergo the space travel simulation, see the galaxy, and then learn about the current truth of planet Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To present our concept and pitch our service, we built our simulation prototype (from scratch and within 2 hours!) with Lego and made a short stop-motion, voice-over video clip. Here‚Äôs Richard the rich kid, the first space traveller!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jammers loved it! Hehe, they wanted to travel to space with us too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recap, the Global Service Jam weekend was dense, compact, and very fun! It is always surprising to see how creativity can turn things around in a short time. It is fascinating to watch how diverse problems could derive from the common point &lt;em&gt;blue&lt;/em&gt; to all sorts of solutions. Other jammers developed services for no-plastic grocery shopping, AR cooking aid for colour-blind people, a space camp, empathy booster, bedside smartphone killer, volunteering inducer‚Ä¶ and presented them all differently. This demonstrated how flexible service design methods can be. While &lt;i&gt;Double Diamond&lt;/i&gt; and ‚Äòyes-and/yes-but‚Äô are nothing new to the industry, ductile application and contextual adjustment of the practice are crucial to problem-solving. The short jam weekend pushed us out of the ordinary box of design and urged us to try, test, and experiment‚Äî‚Äîall while having fun!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>42 hours of co-living with bots&amp;colon; quirky and jolly</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;para-robotics&quot;&gt;Para-robotics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about robots, we might think of automated manufacturing arms, the waste allocator &lt;i&gt;WALL-E&lt;/i&gt;, or even Arnold Schwarzenegger in &lt;i&gt;The Terminator&lt;/i&gt;‚Äî‚Äîoften a very technical, industrial, or sci-fi image. But do robots always have to be linked to work or the apocalypse? What else can robots be in our space and time? What if robots have a more ordinary and nearby relation with us as we have with a book, a plant, or a pair of jeans? What if robots become a new material or medium that we could play and make art with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I participated in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nrw-forum.de/en/events/meta-marathon-2019&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meta Marathon 2019&lt;/a&gt; in D√ºsseldorf organised by NRW-Forum. It tackles exactly this theme. For 42 hours non-stop, I experienced living with robots. The event invited a blend of artists, researchers, creatives and digital innovators to come together, exchange views, and explore the alternative visions towards different kinds of droids. Through an extensive programme of exhibitions, talks and workshops, I was exposed to very diverse perspectives in regard to robotics and humans. It drove me to reflect on our relationship with technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/MM2019-Hall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Meta Marathon 2019 venue hall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-humanhomo-digitalis&quot;&gt;The Future Human‚Äî‚Äî&lt;i&gt;homo digitalis?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day we have more gadgets with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We embrace technology innovations to help us move forward and to elevate our capabilities in doing all sorts of things. A simple click on Google gets us to the tonnes of information one could never imagine 30 years ago. A dense chunk of metal called ‚Äòcomputer‚Äô contains pretty much everything that one would need to do. These days, we do not even leave the house without our smartphone in our hand or pocket. Technologies have been an inseparable part of our life‚Äî‚Äîan ever-growing important element, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sci-fi films, we imagine how futuristic technologies could further enhance us, enable humans to extend what we are capable of doing, and even become part of us. In real life, technology has been a lasting passion of the last two decades. Digital entities have made their way to our habitat and are now holding a ubiquitous role in our everyday business‚Äî‚Äîthat is only to get more prominent. What actually would happen if technology and human are fused into one? How would our interpersonal relations become? Would it even allow us to evolve into a new species‚Äî‚Äî&lt;i&gt;homo digitalis?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/Minority-Report.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Minority-Report&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;extras cap&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Driverless cars, personalised adverts, smart home, facial recognition and predictive policing are here now. In some sense, our world is not that far from Minority Report, is it? (Image: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/minority-report-15th-anniversary-predictive-policing-gesture-based-computing-facial-and-optical-a7807666.html&quot;&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christiane Miethge‚Äôs talk introduced us to this problematic topic. What does it mean when our memory can be transformed, when school-year education can be uploaded within a few hours? How will our society be when we can make friends with AIs? Or even get intimate with robots? How will we look like when we can program our own appearance and health status? We have welcomed technologies into our life and encouraged their emergence. The ultimate question is: until when and where would it remain proper, relevant, and acceptable? She put the questions in perspective through screening her documentary series &lt;i&gt;Homo Digitalis&lt;/i&gt; (now also available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/RC-015228/homo-digitalis/&quot;&gt;ARTE&lt;/a&gt;) and motivated us to find the answers together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;machine-learning-bias&quot;&gt;Machine Learning Bias&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large number of our daily activities circle around data and algorithms: the news we read, the transport we take (regarding scheduling and timetables), the groceries we can get in the supermarket, and even (annoyingly) where we could go for our next holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rely on machines to deal with the massive amount of data which we exponentially create every day. We also depend on them to sort out the links, transform and extract the information, and advise us on the decisions that we shall make. Machines‚Äô calculations with algorithms outrace human actions by far in terms of speed. They can realise efficiently the goals we set. Nevertheless, we cannot always guarantee the quality of the outcome‚Äî‚Äîor more precisely, the quality of the mechanism which leads to the outcome. Only when we notice it, it is usually too late.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/Tay-02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The chatter bot Tay released by Microsoft in 2016 was quickly taken offline 16 hours after the launch as it turned‚Ä¶ fascist.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The chatter bot &lt;i&gt;Tay&lt;/i&gt; released by Microsoft in 2016 was quickly taken offline 16 hours after the launch as it turned‚Ä¶ fascist. (Image: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/3048157/the-internet-turns-tay-microsofts-millennial-ai-chatbot-into-a-racist-bigot.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PCWorld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/24/microsoft-scrambles-limit-pr-damage-over-abusive-ai-bot-tay&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shirley Ogolla landed us on this issue. She highlighted the fact that machines‚Äô decisions result from algorithms, which feed on data, which result from human actions‚Äî‚Äîand furthermore‚Äî‚Äîhuman decisions. As we do not always make impartial decisions, nor do we take unprejudiced action (is this even possible?), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608248/biased-algorithms-are-everywhere-and-no-one-seems-to-care/&quot;&gt;algorithm-driven decisions by machines are prone to bias&lt;/a&gt;. She addressed that attention should be paid to data sets‚Äô quality so as to ensure that diverse and heterogeneous data are included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although neutrality is hard to attain, the wider the coverage is, the closer we get to its possibility. For this to happen, human role is crucial in maintaining the quality and the diversity of the data pool, in rectifying any inaccurate inclination, and in fine-tuning the algorithmic tricks for constant improvement. This is particularly essential as algorithms are now taking up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ai-bias-black-box-sandra-wachter&quot;&gt;pivotal decisions ranging from loan applications to cancer diagnoses&lt;/a&gt;. What is curiously helpful is that AI can also assist us a lot in error and human bias detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/MM2019-AI-in-Bias-Detection.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MM2019-AI-in-Bias-Detection&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;extras cap&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄòIf used correctly, there is an enormous potential for implementing AI. Human intelligence is extremely biased, and AI can help enormously to detect and prevent human bias.‚Äô ‚Äî¬†Sendhil Mullainathan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tech-pain-prevention-and-relief&quot;&gt;Tech Pain Prevention and Relief&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we develop a close bond with digital entities‚Äî‚Äîbe it for work‚Äôs or entertainment‚Äôs sake‚Äî‚Äîwe also experience some drawbacks. Amongst all, health problems come first. We all learn from school that it is not healthy to sit in front of a screen for hours or to use our smartphone in bed. We are advised against it but we continue to adopt the latest gadget released, sticking to them until we feel physical pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not enough just to know the risks but to act to prevent or resolve them. On this, Dasha Ilina brought us to action. In her workshop, I explored how to prevent back and shoulder pain from bad posture in the workplace. I experimented with easily available materials such as cardboard, rubbish bags and rubber gloves, built a &lt;em&gt;back pain killer&lt;/em&gt; prototype, tested it and iterated on the design. It was a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;o-grid&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;extras cap&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My quick and dirty paper prototype; tested, adapted and improved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a 5-year-old child can easily get hold of smartphones and pre-teens as young as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/teenage-technology-addiction-smartphone-rehab-seattle-clinic-children-aged-13-mobile-devices-a7684356.html&quot;&gt;13-years-olds are going to digital rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt;, why are we not starting the education of technology-related health problem prevention (and relief) early? Dasha‚Äôs dynamic workshop guided us to face this often-overlooked issue and attend right to it. It could even bring about the creativity of childhood (&lt;a href=&quot;http://centerfortechpain.com/&quot;&gt;she has done it before!&lt;/a&gt;), too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few highlights from the 42-hour-long event. Other talks included topics of prosthetic robots, techno-sensories and social stigmas (although unfortunately only in German); not to mention there were various performances and interactive exhibits parallel to the programme: cocktail bots, pedicure bot, companion bots, and even sex bots (clean hands only)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I cannot detail them all, &lt;i&gt;Meta Marathon&lt;/i&gt; definitely provided an interesting platform to converge professionals from various fields on the topic of robotics, to exchange views and thoughts on the current and future human-techno relation, and to get an &lt;i&gt;avant-premi√®re&lt;/i&gt; feel of what living with robots could be like.&lt;/p&gt;
